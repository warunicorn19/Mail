# Mail

## This is mailing server made for my CS50W course by HarvardX.

## This performs all the basic tasks a mailing server should be able to execute, like: 
1. Send and recieve emails
2. Archive and Unarchive mail
3. Authenticate Users

### It is built using Python and JavaScript with a Django framework.
